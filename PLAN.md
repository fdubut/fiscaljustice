# Goal

Create a website hosted under the domain name fiscaljustice.com (which I own) that provides two main functionalities:

- Introduce the concept of fiscal justice to the reader, with a specific focus on Washington state fiscal laws and regulations.
- A simulator that allows to set income tax, sales tax and property tax rates, and to see how much revenue is gained or lost accordingly. Additionally, the simulator will show how much closer or further we get from universal healthcare and universal childcare in Washington state based on revenue gain or loss.

# MVP

- Scaffolding to roll out automatically a static website at fiscaljustice.com whenever there is a new commit to the main branch of the fiscaljustice repo.
- Basic navigation between the introduction and the simulator.
- Introduction page.
- Simulation page with basic support for setting income tax (rate and threshold), sales tax (rate) and property tax (rate per $1,000 of assessed value), and automatic calculation of total yearly revenue gained or lost.
- Real-world Washington data to power the simulator.
